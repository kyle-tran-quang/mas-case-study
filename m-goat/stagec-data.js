   STAGE C DATA: beat 11, "the second iteration" (Figma slides 13 > 14 > 15 of frame 208:5718, file 1r4UreOVeEqdcXvnD5cetk).
   One continuous beat with three text slots. The stage never stops between them; the text changes only at rests.

     C1  slide 13  208:7716  THE SECOND ITERATION   dotted wireframe is traced, the dark UI is revealed
     C2  slide 14  208:7911  "Simplify 40 to 10"    the questionnaire scrolls inside its clipped frame
     C3  slide 15  208:8106  "Simplify goals first" camera flies back up and zooms on question 1; a cursor ticks up to 3 options

   Every window is in vh of scroll, LOCAL to the beat (0 = the beat starts). STAGEC.toGlobal(startVh) shifts them to the beat's real position once Stage B settles.
   Rests are sized 20vh + 0.6vh per word (cap 60), the same rule as story.js:
     words  C1 28 -> 37 | C2 24 -> 34 | C3 56 -> 54 (trimmed to 50 to hold the anchor gap)
     anchors C1 94 | C2 167 | C3 272   (gaps 73 and 105vh; the budget is about 55-105)

    // Stage D's report morphs from the REST pose (680x420 dark window at (20, 326.4), 1x, sidebar visible), so the last frame must be that pose.
