/* =========================================================================
   STAGE C (beat 11, "the second iteration"): wiring. Loaded AFTER stage-b.js. It does NOT touch Stage A or B's pieces; it only adds one overlay + one scene hook.
   Pieces / data: stagec-data.js (local timing + copy), stagec-piece.js (the dark screen, scroll, zoom, cursor), stagec.css.
   Windows: TIMING.C (story.js, vh of scroll). Retime there.

   NO SCROLL-DRIVEN C1 ANY MORE. The full-screen generation (cover, wireframe, reveal, backdrop turning dark, frame sliding into the left half) is a one-off, clock-based, scroll-locked
   intro owned by stage-c-intro.js (TIMING.C.intro = { trigger: 778, land: 872 }). This file is the page UNDERNEATH it: from TIMING.C.start (778) to TIMING.C.end (1106) it shows Stage C's LANDED
   layout and nothing else, with no animation between 778 and the first scroll window (893):
     - the dark questionnaire window at its rest pose: 680 x 420.05 at (20, 326.35) of the stage column, 1x, form scrolled to the top, no ticks, no cursor
     - the left half (the stage column) on the backdrop #262626; the right half is the page's own dark text column (#161616, index.html: the beat's theme is dark from 778, no light phase)
   There is no replay. After the intro, scrolling back below 778 hard-cuts to Stage B (the overlay is simply hidden), and scrolling forward again shows the landed state directly.

   WHY AN OVERLAY. The window used to need a full-viewport canvas for C1, and Stage D's hand-over (stage-d.js) is built on this overlay being visible up to TIMING.C.end and hidden past it, so
   C draws into a fixed full-viewport overlay with its OWN engine instance. The overlay's world is placed with the SAME scale and centre rule as the main scene (stage 720 x 1024, fit 1, camera
   0.8/0.8): its stage column coincides with the main stage's pixels.

   HAND-OVER
     in : at 778 the overlay is visible and opaque over the left half (Stage B's v1 + notes sit under it). Stage B's last pieces are keyed out 1vh later so that whatever follows Stage C
          (Stage D) does not find them there again.
     out: the overlay is visible from TIMING.C.start to TIMING.C.end (a pure function of scroll; nothing to call). Its LAST frame is the rest pose (byte-identical to the 778 frame).
          Stage D draws its own identical window and takes over beyond TIMING.C.end. window.StageC = { overlay, end, startVh, T, START } for reference.
