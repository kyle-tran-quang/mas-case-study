   STORY: the single source of truth for the timeline (M-GOAT case study, v2 revised page).
   Source: Figma file 1r4UreOVeEqdcXvnD5cetk, section 241:9902, frame 208:5718 ("Case study / full page (v2 revised)"). Each slide is 1440 x 1024:
   left half = stage, right half = copy. Where a Figma frame exists, its wording wins (decision by the author).

   - range / snap / pose / theme / title drive BOTH halves (scene engine and text column).
       snap = where the beat's text is centred in the viewport.   pose = scene state used with prefers-reduced-motion (defaults to snap).
   - chapter = which of the 12 progress ticks is active (Figma SectionNav: several slides share a tick).
   - eyebrow + copy[] is the right-hand text. copy[] strings may carry inline markup: <span class="hl-o"> (orange), <i> (italic).

   BUILD STATUS (staged build; each stage is checked in a browser before the next):
     Stage A  beats 1-7   leaf ring -> dashboard -> tiles -> city art -> ALM skeleton -> hand card -> capabilities diagram     <- this file
     Stage B  beats 8-10  7-layer stack (blueprint) -> journey simulator -> first iteration (blueprint)
     Stage C  beat 11     second iteration: a one-off clock-based intro (stage-c-intro.js) lands on the dark window; then scroll the form, zoom on question 1     <- stage-c.js
     Stage D  beats 12-15 report -> trust + disclosure -> APM expansion card (hover loop) -> numbers zoom     <- stage-d.js
     Stage E  beats 16-17 next steps card -> zoom on "How to implement" (slides 20a, 20b)     <- stage-e.js   (slides 21 maturity maps, 22 to be continued: not built yet)

   PACING (see the worksheet shown at Gate 3): every text anchor sits in a REST (stage still), sized 20vh + 0.6vh per word (cap 60). All motion windows live in
   TIMING below (vh of scroll); scene-data.js reads them from there.
     anchors  numbers 0 | curve 75 | ninety 145 | opportunity 220 | problem 295 | goal 370 | purpose 445 | capabilities 525 (everything after shifted +75vh)

       questionnaire window at its rest pose in the left half (backdrop #262626), the dark text column on the right. No replay: after the intro, scrolling back below 778 hard-cuts to Stage B and
